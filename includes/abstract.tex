    Performant SMT solvers rely on powerful heuristics and highly optimized implementations
    that need to be validated and tested. 
    To do this researchers often depend 
    on tedious to produce hand-crafted benchmarks, and hard to procure industrial suites.
    In this paper we offer an alternative to string \smt{} solver developers: 
    \fuzzer{}, a modular problem transformer and generator.
    We showcase \fuzzer{} by producing a repository of \smtfull{} format problems;
    systemically comparing \theSolvers{} on these problems; and 
    identifying causes of performance degradations in \us{}.
