    In this paper we introduce \fuzzer{}: a modular \smt{} problem transformer and generator for string solvers. We supply a repository of problems we generated with \fuzzer{} in \smtfull{} format, and demonstrate its usefulness by showing defects it helped find and fix in a mature solver: \us{}. We also test the solvers \theSolvers{} with suites of \fuzzer{} problems that elicit poor performance in some of the solvers, but not in others. We briefly analyse our experimental results, and identify the causes of the performance degradations in \us{}.
