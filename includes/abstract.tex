    In this paper we present \fuzzer{}: an \smtlib{} problem fuzzer and generator for string solvers. We provide a rich repository of problems we generated with \fuzzer{} in \smt{} format. We also analyse \numSolvers{} mature string solvers: \theSolvers{}. We use \fuzzer{} to craft inputs that elicit poor performance in \us{} and \cvc{}, and analyse the causes of the performance degradations. We then describe an algorithm to mitigate the performance degradation in \us{}. Finally, we describe several bugs in \us{} that were exposed by \fuzzer{}.
