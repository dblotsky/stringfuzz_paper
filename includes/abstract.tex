    In this paper, we introduce \fuzzer{}: a modular \smt{} problem transformer and generator for string solvers. We supply a repository of problems generated by \fuzzer{} in \smtfull{} format. We systemically compare \theSolvers{} on groups of such problems focusing on different combinations of string operators, and identify problems that are particularly challenging for some solvers. We briefly explain our observations and showcase how \fuzzer{} helped identify causes of performance degradations in \us{}.
