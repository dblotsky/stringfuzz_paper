    In this paper we present \fuzzer{}: an \smt{} problem fuzzer and generator for string solvers. With it we analyse \numSolvers{} mature string solvers: \theSolvers{}. We use it to craft inputs that elicit poor performance in \us{} and \cvc{}, and provide analyses of the causes of the performance degradations. Our experimental data suggest that there are classes of problems that will always be hard for \us{} and easy for \cvc{}, and vice versa, due to the limitations of the core algorithms implemented by those solvers. We also present several minor bugs in \us{} that were exposed by \fuzzer{}. Finally, we provide a rich repository of problems in \smt{} format, generated both by \fuzzer{} and by hand, to encourage other solver authors to likewise improve their solvers.
