\section{Introduction}

    Many SMT solvers that support the theory of strings have been developed over the past decade, and several have matured to the point of being performant and practically useful. Moreover a standard input language, \smt{}\cite{smt}, has been developed and many mature solvers support it.

    Our contributions follow. We describe the \fuzzer{} tool: a fuzzer of \smt{} string and regex problems. We then present a large suite of \smt{} string and regex problems we generated with \fuzzer{}. Then we describe two specific inputs - \cHard{} and \zHard{} - and experiments that show uniquely poor performance in \cvc{} and \us{} on those inputs, respectively. Finally, we recommend an algorithm to alleviate the poor performance in \us{}.
