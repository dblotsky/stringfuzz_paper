\section{Introduction}

    Many SMT solvers that support the theory of strings have been developed over the past decade, and several have matured to the point of being performant and practically useful. Moreover a standard input language, \smt{}, has been developed and many mature solvers support it.

    In this paper, we present the following contributions:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \fuzzer{}: a fuzzer of \smt{} string and regex problems.
        \item Generated inputs that elicit poor performance in \us{} and \cvc{}.
        \item A recommended fix to \us{} that alleviates the poor performance.
        \item A large suite of \smt{} string and regex problems we generated with \fuzzer{}.
    \end{enumerate}
