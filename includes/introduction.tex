\section{Introduction}

    Many SMT solvers that support the theory of strings have been developed over the past decade, and several have matured to the point of being performant and practically useful. Moreover a standard input language, \smt{} (versions 2, 2.1, and 2.5), has been developed and many mature solvers support it.

    \subsection{Prior Work}

        Other fuzzers exist, but none of them support the theory of strings. We found these:

    \subsection{Contributions}

        In this paper, we present the following contributions:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item StringFuzzG, a generator of \smt{} string problems
            \item StringFuzzX, a transformer of \smt{} string problems
            \item Experiments that show evidence of poor performance in \us{} and \cvc{}
            \item A recommended fix to \us{} that alleviates the poor performance
            \item A suite of \smt{} problems
        \end{itemize}

        In the following sections, we elaborate on each of these items.
