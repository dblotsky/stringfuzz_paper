\section{Prior Work}

    There are several fuzzers and problem generators currently available, but none of them support string or regex generation or transformation. For example the FuzzSMT\cite{fuzzsmt} tool generates \smt{} problems with bit vectors and arrays, but does not support strings or regexes. The SMTpp\cite{smtpp} tool preprocesses and simplifies problems, but does not generate new ones or fuzz existing ones.
