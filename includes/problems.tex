\section{Problem Suites}

    We generated several suites of string and regex problems using \fuzzer{}, and they are available at \problemRepo{}. They are described in more detail below.

    \subsubsection{\fuzzer{}-Generated}

        This suite contains the following problem sets: \\

        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
            \hline
            \textbf{Name}    & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
            Lengths          & \todo{} \\ \hline
            Lengths-Concats  & \todo{} \\ \hline
            Concats          & \todo{} \\ \hline
            Concats-Extracts & \todo{} \\ \hline
            Overlaps         & \todo{} \\ \hline
            Regex            & \todo{} \\ \hline
            Many-Regexes     & \todo{} \\ \hline
            Regex-Deep       & \todo{} \\ \hline
            Regex-Pair       & \todo{} \\ \hline
            Regex-Lengths    & \todo{} \\ \hline
            Random??         & \todo{} \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}

        \hfill \\

        Most of these problem sets either have a dedicated generator in \generator{}, or are variations of one. While it is likely that some of the pre-made suites will be immediately useful in analysing a solver, we also found that mass randomisation was helpful in finding some bugs, and we encourage this pattern as well. \generator{} is designed to be used in an exploratory fashion. For example the following usage has helped us find bugs in \us{}:

        {\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
while true; do stringfuzzg --random regex | z3str3 -in; done\end{verbatim}}

        Some simple UNIX scripting can yield more interesting results. For example the following script finds a regex problem on which \us{} times out after 5 seconds:

        {\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}while true; do
    stringfuzzg --random regex --coincide --num-regexes 2 --num-terms 5 --depth 3 > hard-problem.smt2
    result=`z3str3 -T:5 hard-problem.smt2`
    echo $result
    if [ "$result" == "timeout" ]; then
        cat hard-problem.smt2
        break
    fi
done\end{verbatim}}

    \subsubsection{\fuzzer{}-Transformed}

        This suite contains the following problem sets: \\

        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
            \hline
            \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
            Amazon??      & \todo{} \\ \hline
            Regex??       & \todo{} \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}

        \hfill \\

        Most of these problem sets were generated by using one root problem and transforming it with \transformer{} into many similar problems.

    \subsubsection{Unit Tests}

        This suite covers corner cases of solver behaviour. We have used the instances in this suite to find bugs in \us{}.

    \subsection{Bugs Found}

        This section describes the bugs in \us{} that were discovered (and subsequently fixed) by testing it with the \fuzzer{} problem suites.

        \todo{}: Describe the length lookup bug and length-testing bug, giving the before/after commits.
