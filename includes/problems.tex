\section{Problem Suites}

    We generated several suites of string and regex problems using \fuzzer{}, and they are available at \problemRepo{}. They are described in more detail below.

    \subsubsection{\fuzzer{}-Generated}

        This suite contains the following problem sets: \\

        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
            \hline
            \textbf{Name}    & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
            Lengths          & \\ \hline
            Lengths-Concats  & \\ \hline
            Concats          & \\ \hline
            Concats-Extracts & \\ \hline
            Overlaps         & \\ \hline
            Regex            & \\ \hline
            Many-Regexes     & \\ \hline
            Regex-Deep       & \\ \hline
            Regex-Pair       & \\ \hline
            Regex-Lengths    & \\ \hline
            Random??         & \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}

        \hfill \\

        Most of these problem sets either have a dedicated generator in \generator{}, or are variations of one. While it is likely that some of the pre-made suites will be immediately useful in analysing a solver, we also found that mass randomisation was helpful in finding some bugs, and we encourage this pattern as well. \generator{} is designed to be used in an exploratory fashion. For example the following usage has helped us find bugs in \us{}: \\

        {\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
while true; do stringfuzzg --random regex | z3str3 -in; done\end{verbatim}}

    \subsubsection{\fuzzer{}-Transformed}

        This suite contains the following problem sets: \\

        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
            \hline
            \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
            Amazon??      & \\ \hline
            Regex??       & \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}

        \hfill \\

        Most of these problem sets were generated by using one root problem and transforming it with \transformer{} into many similar problems.

    \subsubsection{Unit Tests}

        This suite covers corner cases of solver behaviour. We have used the instances in this suite to find bugs in \us{}.

    \subsection{Bugs Found}

        This section describes the bugs in \us{} that were discovered (and subsequently fixed) by testing it with the \fuzzer{} problem suites, as follows: \\

        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
            \hline
            \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Before Fix} & \textbf{After Fix} \\ \hline
            length lookup  & & & \\ \hline
            length-testing & & & \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
