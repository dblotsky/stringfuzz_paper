\section{Problem Suites}

    We generated several suites of string and regex problems using \fuzzer{}. These problems are available at \problemRepo{}. Below, we describe the \texttt{generated} suite that we generated using \generator{}:

    \todo{Fill in descriptions.}

    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Name}    & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
        Lengths          & \\ \hline
        Lengths-Concats  & \\ \hline
        Concats          & \\ \hline
        Concats-Extracts & \\ \hline
        Overlaps         & \\ \hline
        Regex            & \\ \hline
        Many-Regexes     & \\ \hline
        Regex-Deep       & \\ \hline
        Regex-Pair       & \\ \hline
        Regex-Lengths    & \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \hfill \\ \\

    The \texttt{transformerd} suite contains problems generated by using one root problem and transforming it with \transformer{} into many similar problems. They are described below:

    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
        Amazon        & \\ \hline
        Regex         & \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}

    \subsection{Results}

        This section describes the bugs we discovered in \us{} (that were subsequently fixed) by testing it with the \fuzzer{} problem suites.

        \todo{Describe the length lookup bug and length-testing bug, giving the before/after commits.}

    \subsection{Patterns}

        While the aforementioned suites are useful in analysing a solver, we also used randomised \fuzzer{} runs for exploratory debugging. For example the following usage can feed random problems to \cvc{} until it returns an error:

        {\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
while stringfuzzg -r random | tee problem.smt25 | cvc4 --lang smt2.5 --tlimit=5000; do
    sleep 0
done\end{verbatim}}

        Some \unix{} scripting can yield other interesting results. For example the following script finds a regex problem on which \us{} times out after 5 seconds:

        {\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}while true; do
    stringfuzzg -r regex -c -a increasing -r 2 -t 5 -d 3 > problem.smt25
    result=`z3str3 -T:5 problem.smt25`
    echo $result
    if [ "$result" == "timeout" ]; then
        cat hard-problem.smt2
        break
    fi
done\end{verbatim}}
