\section{\fuzzer{}}

    This section describes the fuzzer \fuzzer{}, which generates new \smt{} problems and transforms existing ones. \fuzzer{} is implemented as a Python package, and comes with several executables to generate, transform, and analyse \smt{} string problems.

    % Its source code repository is available at \sourceRepo{}. It can either be installed from source, or from the Python PIP package repository.

    The \fuzzer{} code is organised to be easily extended: all generators and transformers are independent modules. Its components are also implemented as \unix{} ``filters'', to enable easy integration with other tools (including themselves). For example, the outputs of generators can be piped directly into transformers, and transformers can be chained to produce a tuned stream of challenging inputs to a solver.

    Below are descriptions of the tools that constitute \fuzzer{}:

        \item[\texttt{stringfuzzg}] \hfill \\
            This tool generates \smt{} problems. It supports several generators and options that specify its output. The generators it implements are: \\

        \item[\texttt{stringstats}] \hfill \\
            This tool takes as input an \smt{} problem, and outputs its properties, such as: numbers of string variables and literals, max/median syntactic depth of expressions, and max/median length of literals.

            \hfill

        \item[\texttt{stringmerge}] \hfill \\
            This tool takes as input two \smt{} problems and combines them into one problem.
