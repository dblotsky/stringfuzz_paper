\section{Instance Suites}
\label{sec:suites}

In this section, we describe the benchmark suites we generated
with \fuzzer{}, and on which we conducted our experimental
evaluation. Table~\ref{tbl:generated} lists instances that were
generated by \generator{}. Table~\ref{tbl:transformed} lists instances
derived from existing seed instances by iteratively applying \transformer{}.
Every transformed instance is named according to its
seed and the transformations it undertook. For example,
\texttt{z3-regex-1-fuzz-graft.smt2} was transformed by applying
\textit{Fuzz} and then \textit{Graft} to \texttt{z3-regex-1.smt2}.

The \textit{Amazon} category contains 472 instances derived from two seeds
supplied by our industrial collaborators. The \textit{Regex} category is
seeded by the \usOld{} regex test suite~\cite{z3str2-tests}, which contains
42 instances. Through cumulative transformations we expanded the
42 seeds to 7,551 unique instances. Finally, the \textit{Sanitizer} category
is obtained from five industrial e-mail address and IPv4 sanitizers.
